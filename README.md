# Jukevox
Music hybrid mobile application

## Presentation

Jukevox is a hybrid mobile application for creating collaborative music playlists,
available for android and ios.

We were 4 to work on this project.

The app allows you to create events and invite your friends in. After that, everyone can
add his favorite songs to the event, and vote for the ones he wants to listen first.
The playlist is sorted by votes and played in this specific order.

The event creator can also give the music player's control to other members, giving them
the ability to control it from their phone without moving.
